                            EcoAlliance was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate environmentalists who saw the need for a
                            community-based approach to conservation. What began as a small local initiative has grown into a
                            nationwide movement with thousands of volunteers and supporters.

                            Over the years, we've planted over 10,000 trees, cleaned countless beaches and waterways, established
                            community gardens, and educated thousands of people about sustainable living practices. Our growth has
                            been fueled by the dedication of our volunteers and the generosity of our donors.

                            Today, EcoAlliance continues to expand its reach and impact, developing innovative programs and
